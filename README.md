# Commuting in Montreal
This project visualizes commuter modal shares by census tract in the Montreal Census Metropolitain Area (CMA). Specifically, it plots the share of 2021 Census-takers, in each Census tract, commuting to work by personal vehicle, with public transit, or by active transportation, respectively. While commuting patterns reported in 2021 were likely altered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the visualization remains a good indication of residents in various parts of the city commute to work.

## Data
Data is gathered from Statistics Canada's [Table 98-10-0480-01](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=9810048001). The Census boundary lines - that is, data outlining the boundaries of each census tract - are made available by [Statistics Canada](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/geo/sip-pis/boundary-limites/index2021-eng.cfm?year=21).
