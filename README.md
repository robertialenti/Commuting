# Commuting in Montreal
This project visualizes commuter modal shares by census tract in Montreal. Specifically, it plots the share of 2021 Census-takers, in each Census tract, commuting to work by personal vehicle, with public transit, or by active transportation, respectively. While commuting patterns reported in 2021 were likely altered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the visualization remains a good indication of residents in various parts of the city commute to work.
